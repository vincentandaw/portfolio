    "        I specialize in econometric and machine-learning methods of econometric and/or financial forecasting – I have built this base with my undergraduate double major in Economics and Data Science as well as my Master’s in Applied Economics. But at its heart, my specialization is numerical problem-solving using an advanced understanding of statistical theory and tools, where every problem is so nuanced that there does not exist a one-size-fits-all panacea. Rather, an expert in this subject matter is needed to negotiate the troubles that data can stir up. Indeed, I create models that can explain historical phenomena or forecast future ones so that a client can benefit. This is why it would be beneficial for your organization to hire an applied economist such as myself.\n",

Furthermore, my strong data background allows me to excel in data-related functions, from creating advanced Excel spreadsheets and/or PowerBI reports and visualizations, to finding, preprocessing and analyzing my data from a variety of sources, such as databases, or whether I have to web-scrape my own data using python for when data is hardly available.
