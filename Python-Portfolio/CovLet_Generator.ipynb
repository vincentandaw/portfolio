    "        In my previous job at Navy Federal Credit Union as a systems governance engineer, I created data pipelines that started with database management and information gathering and ended in PowerBI or Excel spreadsheet reports. I did this as the previous process was manual and prone to human error, plus it took too long and wasted my team’s time. My education in Data Science and Applied Economics trained me not only to acquire, preprocess and optimize my data, but also to store it in an efficient and purpose-driven format for large-scale collaboration.\n",
    "        Data is messy – this I learned not just from school but was also borne out in my experience. My strong data background has allowed me to excel in my classes at Johns Hopkins, and my professors have only good things to say about me. In fact, I utilized “unconventional” data acquisition methods like web-scraping for class projects, which allowed me to go beyond simply downloading neatly packaged data and running piecemeal code. And to further sharpen my skills, I have also attained the International Institute of Forecasters Certificate. \n",
